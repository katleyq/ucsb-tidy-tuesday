# UCSB #TidyTuesday Coding Club

Every Tuesday, the #R4DS online learning community releases an interesting dataset for R users to wrangle, visualize, and share with the broader data science community on Twitter using #TidyTuesday (example datasets).

This tradition was brought to UCSB by Dr. Allison Horst and Gracie White (MESM alum) in 2019. It served as a stress-free space where people of all coding levels could build community while wrangling data and producing some cool data visualizations together. It's a great opportunity to share your knowledge and learn from others about how to work with data.
